## To build

`npm run build` this runs `tsc` and `webpack`

## To view:

`npm run start` then navigate to localhost:8080

Alternatively load index.html as a file URL (requires
--allow-file-access-from-files in Chrome.)

## Watcher:

`npm run watch` will run webpack in watch mode.

Typescript files are compiled and bundled automatically on save, while the
watcher is active.

## To test:

`npm test` will run tests using karma.
