**To build:**  
`npm run build` this runs `tsc` and `webpack`

**To view:**  
`npm run server` then navigate to localhost:8080


**Watcher:**  
`npm run watch` will run webpack in watch mode.

Typescript files are compiled automatically on save, so any changes in the JS files will automatically bundle, while the watcher is active.
